# Mykyta: This is the default React .gitignore, I kept it as is
# Oren: Removed the .env files from the ignore list, so that we can share them with the team,
##      also removed node_modules from the ignore list for faster start up times.
# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/ for more about ignoring files.
